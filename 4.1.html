            <h3>Introducing the 20 most popular websites</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Google</li>
                <li>YouTube</li>
                <li>Amazon</li>
                <li>Facebook</li>
                <li>Yahoo</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There’s no doubt that <a href="https://www.google.com"  class="google">Google</a> is the most popular 
                search engine, <br> but
                this year it remains at the top spot
                as the most popular website on the internet.
                <br> Over 40k searches are reported each second on Google <br> —
                which translates to over 1.2 trillion searches per year! <br> No matter what someone wants to know, Google is
                the go-to. <br> Not only that, <br>
                but Google also now serves as the hub for a plethora of other web services
                including Google Docs, <br>
                 Google Calendar, Google Drive and many more.
            </p>
            <p>This website jumped up the list two spots this year as it’s impressive stats continue to climb. <br>
                Almost 5
                billion videos are watched on <a href="https://www.youtube.com"  class="youtube">YouTube</a> every 
                single day. <br>
                YouTube gets over 30 million visitors per day. <br>
                Every minute, over 300 minutes of video is uploaded to
                YouTube.
                <br>We expect to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com"  class="youtube">YouTube</a> in the top three for a long time
                to come.</p>
            <p>Down one spot from last year, <br>
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com"  class="amazon">Amazon</a> is still 
                one of the top three
                most popular website on the internet
                and dominates the online shopping world. <br>
                From <a href="https://www.amazon.com" class="amazon">Amazon.com</a> , <br> site visitors can purchase their favorite books,
                clothing, home goods, groceries and
                more! <br> And, if they sign up for the Prime membership, <br>
                those purchases can be delivered to their front
                door within just a day or two — for free! <br> With such a wide variety of goods and such amazing service,
                <br>
                it’s no wonder Amazon is one of the leaders again this year.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com" class="facebook">Facebook</a> is the leading social media platform 
                across the world. <br>
                Its innovative design has changed the way
                people communicate and live their lives. <br>
                Every month, the website boasts an impressive 2.37 billion users. <br> 1.66 billion people on average log
                onto Facebook daily <br>
                and are considered daily active users (Facebook DAU) as of January 2020, <br>
                 which
                represents a 9% increase year over year.</p>
            <p>Still going strong is <a href="https://www.yahoo.com" class="yahoo">Yahoo.com</a>. <br>
                Yahoo was the leading search engine
                and news source for a very long time <br>
                and still can hold it’s own as one of the most popular websites online. <br>
                The model has changed a bit however as it really has found more traction for news, <br>
                articles, finance,
                etc. vs purely a search engine.</p>
